# springboard_project_inferential_statistics

This Python notebook contains the p-value calculations, differences of means, error margins, confidence intervals, and correlations for different stats from my dataset which is made up of NBA players who have played for at least five years and players who have not played for five years.  

I performed inferential statistics and conducted a hypothesis test on the two groups of players.
